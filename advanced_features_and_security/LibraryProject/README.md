## Permissions and Groups Setup

### Custom Permissions:
- **can_view**: Allows viewing of books.
- **can_create**: Allows creation of new books.
- **can_edit**: Allows editing of existing books.
- **can_delete**: Allows deletion of books.

### User Groups:
- **Editors**: Can create and edit books.
- **Viewers**: Can only view books.
- **Admins**: Have full access to create, edit, view, and delete books.

### Implementation:
Permissions are enforced in views using the `@permission_required` decorator. Ensure users are assigned to the correct groups to manage access appropriately.
### Documentation:
This project includes several security enhancements to protect against common vulnerabilities:

Debug Mode Disabled:

DEBUG is set to False in production to prevent the display of detailed error pages to users.
Browser Security Headers:

XSS Protection: Enabled with SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True.
Clickjacking Protection: Implemented with X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'.
MIME Type Sniffing Protection: Enabled with SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True.
Secure Cookies:

CSRF and session cookies are secured over HTTPS with CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True.
These settings are configured to enhance the security of the application by mitigating risks associated with XSS, CSRF, and other common web vulnerabilities.
